# Are there any "real" applications suitable for the pico library?

The library is used in a number of commercial, scientific and open source projects.

These include:

* **Visage Technologies** (a face tracking company, see <http://visagetechnologies.com>) 
* **Lamassu** (a bitcoin ATM company, see <https://lamassu.is> and <https://github.com/lamassu/node-supyo>)
* **nope.c** (a platform for scalable server-side and networking applications, see <http://nopedotc.com/gallery>)
* **Darko Juric** (traffic light detection, see "A Method for On-road Night-time Vehicle Headlight Detection and Tracking", 10th International Symposium on Visual Computing, 2014)
